What do you call someone who leaves the world of newspapers and web production to go do the bidding of whomever client can foot the bill? A recovering journalist &mdash; and here's why you should consider rehab too.

[[ College Photojournalist -> Multimedia Intern -> Web Producer -> Multimedia Journalist XXX Developer ]]

So just recently, about two weeks ago, I left my job in journalism. Aaaand, I noticed things began to change. First, I stopped seeing this by the coffee machine.

And now, we literally have this in our office.

I still drink just as much, but now I drink on the job.

[[ ??? ]]

But so other things began to change too and I started thinking about what exactly I had done and what I really began to ponder was why had it been so easy.

[[ Same as First Graphic, but College Journalist Bolded In ]]

Like many of you I grew UP thinking I'd be a journalist, and that it was my calling to like throw truth into the wilderness and, I'd put in my time and one day I'd get to be him.

Or maybe him.

Which by the way did you all know there is this Japanese Spiderman live action series from the 70's where he's basically a power ranger?

It's good right?

Here's another one. PAUSE. Seeing this was really confusing for me because that's just not the type of journalist I envisioned becoming.

[[ Back to First Graphic, but Web Producer Bolded In ]]

But so I graduated and started working as a web producer, which was a great position when I started because you only had to have like WordPress level web skills.

And if you were born before the 90's, you all made this WordPress page. Don't lie.

But so you end up doing this job that's like, the future, and the internet, this conduit to all these people, but you're just mostly with other people's work, a translator between mediums. Your own contribution, which everyone top down basically agrees is really important, is not visible.

[[ The Github Visualization ]]

This is a data visualization that many people here are familiar with, it's the history of my activity on Github. And you might see a trend here...

[[ Overlay time at Dev Seed ]]

At Dev Seed we put everything on Github, and we open source a lot of it, we actually don't send each other emails anymore, we use Github's issue tracker for all of that. And you don't have to work at a capital S startup to use Github this way.

And so I was wondering why, and it occured to me that what I was doing was now, finally, visible.

[[ Visible ]]

And doing visible work is great because you can point to it later and say here's my code, I can do Angular or Rails or whatever. And that's going to come in handy because I bet most of the people in this room aren't planning to work their current jobs forever. And when you're interviewing for a new job it's a lot harder to show someone how well you maintained this website.
