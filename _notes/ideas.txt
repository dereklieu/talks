Don't End the Week With Nothing
(Journalism Tech Edition)

1. Whether you're in journalism, technology, or something else, you should strive to work on visible projects.

    a. Someone out there worked on a really visible project, and this is where it got her.

2. Let's figure out what a visible journalism project is, and how that applies from the technology world.

    a. Five minute timer
    b. Show something that moves

3. If your current position does not allow you to work on visible projects, where can you find one that does?

4. Here are some visible projects and things that you can work on!

5. Here are some really great side projects you can work on!


Prefer to work on things you can show. Prefer to work where people can see you. Prefer to work on things that you can own.

Work you can show: Github and OSS. Put it all on there and keep putting it on there!

Talk about what you're doing. Do something that you can talk about. I'm using Angular.js for this presentation. I stole the idea wholesale from a conference I was at last week. I've made it easier for you to steal it.

If you can't do this at work, do this outside of work, until you can get somewhere that lets you do this at work.

Vanishingly few people are perfect diamonds. The projects you take don't have to be sexy, but they should have impact and visibility.

What is the most open, visible data you could possibly work on?

That's great because we all work on the web! It's front-facing by default! So do something with it!

Stacking the bricks is a great way to think about this as well.
